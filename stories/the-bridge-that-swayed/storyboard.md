# The Bridge That Swayed

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Resonance and the Millennium Bridge*
> *Location: London, England*
> *Domain: engineering*

## Sequence Overview

The story of London's Millennium Bridge, which swayed dangerously on opening day due to synchronized pedestrian footsteps creating a positive feedback loop. Teaches resonance, feedback loops, and damping solutions in structural engineering.
