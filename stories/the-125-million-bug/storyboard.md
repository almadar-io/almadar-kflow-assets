# The $125 Million Bug

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Mars Climate Orbiter Unit Conversion Failure*
> *Location: NASA JPL / Deep Space*
> *Domain: science*

## Sequence Overview

The story of how a simple unit conversion error — pounds-force-seconds vs newton-seconds — doomed a $125 million Mars spacecraft. Teaches the critical importance of unit consistency, dimensional analysis, and cross-team communication in engineering.

### Shot 01 — COVER — 16:9

**Camera:** Wide dramatic space shot
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Mars dominates the frame, spacecraft descending too close
**Action:** The Mars Climate Orbiter glows with atmospheric friction as it plunges toward Mars
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The catastrophic consequence of a small oversight

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft glowing with atmospheric friction as it descends too close to Mars with a faint overlay of the equation 1 lbf s equals 4.448 N s and warning indicators, dramatic space scene with Mars looming large and red, volumetric dust and warm amber tones

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 02 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Split-screen wide shot
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Two engineering offices side by side, imperial vs metric charts
**Action:** Two teams of engineers working independently on the same mission
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The disconnect hiding in plain sight

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, two teams of engineers working in separate offices one with imperial measurement charts on the wall in Denver the other with metric SI charts in Pasadena, split-screen composition showing the disconnect, warm lamp-lit workspaces with monitors and spacecraft diagrams

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 03 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Wide deep-space shot
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Spacecraft cruising through space with subtle trajectory divergence
**Action:** Small thruster firings shown as tiny bursts with faint trajectory lines diverging
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The quiet accumulation of error in the vastness of space

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, a spacecraft cruising through deep space with small thruster firings shown as tiny bursts with faint trajectory lines subtly diverging from the planned path, dark vast space backdrop with distant stars, warm amber instrument glow on the spacecraft hull

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 04 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Data visualization overhead
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Graph showing predicted vs actual trajectory diverging over 9 months
**Action:** Solid predicted line and dashed actual line slowly diverging with correction arrows compounding
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The creeping realization captured in data

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, a graph showing predicted trajectory as a solid line versus actual trajectory as a dashed line slowly diverging over 9 months with small correction arrows that compound the error, data visualization style rendered as illuminated marginalia on aged vellum, warm amber and teal accent tones

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 05 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Close dramatic space shot
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Spacecraft breaking apart in the thin Martian atmosphere
**Action:** The spacecraft glows red-hot from atmospheric friction plunging 57 km too close to Mars
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The violent irreversible consequence of compounded error

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, a spacecraft glowing red-hot from atmospheric friction as it plunges into the thin Martian atmosphere far too close to the rust-colored surface breaking apart, dramatic cinematic space disaster scene with debris trailing, warm amber and deep red palette against the dark of space

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 06 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Medium interior shot
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Engineers gathered around a whiteboard with the conversion equation circled in red
**Action:** Somber post-mortem review with the failed mission timeline on a screen behind them
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The lesson learned — the human cost of a simple mismatch

**Start Frame:** scientific instruments visible, clean educational overlays, observatory/laboratory setting, engineers gathered around a whiteboard showing the equation 1 lbf s equals 4.448 N s circled in red marker with somber expressions, the failed mission timeline visible on a screen behind them, warm subdued lamp lighting in a conference room, matte surfaces and aged instrument aesthetic

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures
