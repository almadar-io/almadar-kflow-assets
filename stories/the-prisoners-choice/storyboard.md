# The Prisoner's Choice

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Game Theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma*
> *Location: Interrogation Rooms, Academic Setting*
> *Domain: math*

## Sequence Overview

The story of two arrested suspects who must independently decide whether to cooperate or betray each other, introducing the Prisoner's Dilemma. Teaches game theory fundamentals — Nash equilibrium, iterated games, and how cooperation can emerge from repeated strategic interaction.

**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** Separation and the loss of communication

**Start Frame:** geometric patterns and mathematical curves rendered as illuminated marginalia, two people being led into separate interrogation rooms by detectives in a concrete corridor, a thick wall dividing the rooms, documents visible on each table inside, noir crime drama atmosphere with harsh fluorescent overhead lighting and deep shadows

**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** The elegant mathematics behind the dilemma

**Start Frame:** geometric patterns and mathematical curves rendered as illuminated marginalia, a 2x2 payoff matrix drawn on a dark academic blackboard with four outcome cells filled in showing years of imprisonment, a mathematician's hand with chalk pointing to the Nash equilibrium cell highlighted with a glowing circle, warm classroom lighting, chalk dust in the air

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** Repetition changes everything — the shadow of the future

**Start Frame:** geometric patterns and mathematical curves rendered as illuminated marginalia, a horizontal timeline showing 10 rounds of a repeated game with green cooperate circles and red defect circles forming visible patterns, cooperation streaks and retaliation sequences clearly visible, clean infographic style on dark background with glowing connections between rounds

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures

### Shot 06 — SCENE — 4:3

**Camera:** Tournament bracket visualization
**Movement:** Static
**Staging:** Tournament bracket with strategy names competing
**Action:** Tit-for-Tat rises to the top as champion
**Transition IN:** None
**Transition OUT:** None
**Audio:**
  - SFX: None
  - Music: None
  - Dialogue: None
**Emotional beat:** Simple reciprocity wins — cooperation triumphs

**Start Frame:** geometric patterns and mathematical curves rendered as illuminated marginalia, a tournament bracket showing game theory strategy names competing with Tit-for-Tat rising to the top as champion highlighted in gold, clean celebratory infographic style, dark background with warm golden accents on the winning path, mathematical elegance in the bracket design

**Negative Prompt:** text, words, letters, numbers, writing, captions, labels, signatures
