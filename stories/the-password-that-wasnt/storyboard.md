# The Password That Wasn't

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Hashing, Salting, and Password Security*
> *Location: Modern Server Room, Cybersecurity Setting*
> *Domain: tech*

## Sequence Overview

The story of a security auditor who discovers a breached database and traces how weak hashing allowed attackers to crack passwords. Teaches cryptographic hashing, rainbow tables, and why salted slow hashes like bcrypt exist — through the lens of debugging a real security failure.
