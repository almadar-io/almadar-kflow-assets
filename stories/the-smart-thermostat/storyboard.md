# The Smart Thermostat

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Feedback Loops and Event-Driven Control*
> *Location: Modern Smart Home*
> *Domain: engineering*

## Sequence Overview

The story of how feedback loops and event-driven control evolved from James Watt's centrifugal governor to modern smart thermostats. Teaches event handling, hysteresis, and composable control rules.
