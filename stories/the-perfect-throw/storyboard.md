# The Perfect Throw

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Projectile Motion and the 45-Degree Optimum*
> *Location: Renaissance Workshop / Physics Laboratory*
> *Domain: science*

## Sequence Overview

The story of projectile motion, from Galileo's inclined plane experiments to the range equation. Teaches how horizontal and vertical motion combine into parabolic trajectories, why 45 degrees maximizes range in a vacuum, and how air resistance changes the game in the real world.
