# The Merchant's Scale

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — Density, Displacement, and Classification*
> *Location: Medieval Mediterranean, Ancient Greece*
> *Domain: history*

## Sequence Overview

The story of Archimedes' discovery of density and water displacement, told through a medieval merchant who must determine if his gold coins are genuine. Teaches classification through physical measurement — separating real gold from counterfeits using density as a feature.
