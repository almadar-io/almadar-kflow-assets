# The Traffic Light

> *Mission: Knowledge Story — State Machines and Traffic Control*
> *Location: Urban Intersection*
> *Domain: engineering*

## Sequence Overview

The story of the traffic light as the quintessential state machine, from Victorian gas-lit semaphores to modern intelligent intersections. Teaches finite state machines, safe transitions, and the universality of state-based design.
