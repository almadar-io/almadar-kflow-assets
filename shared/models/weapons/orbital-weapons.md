A round tower shield weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A compact one-handed round shield roughly 60cm in diameter. The frame is forged from dark steel with riveted edges and a central boss (raised dome in the center). The steel frame has a brushed gunmetal finish with subtle copper rivet accents around the rim. The frame forms a circular border approximately 4cm wide.

The interior face of the shield — the area inside the steel frame — is filled with a translucent hard-light energy barrier. The energy field is a bright teal-cyan color, semi-transparent with a subtle hexagonal honeycomb pattern visible within it, like a force field. The energy field emits a soft teal glow that illuminates the inner edge of the steel frame.

On the back of the shield, a simple horizontal grip bar and a forearm strap, both dark steel. The grip is sized for a robot hand.

Color palette: dark gunmetal steel frame, copper rivets, bright teal-cyan energy field with subtle glow. The energy barrier should be clearly the focal point — it reads as "this shield projects energy, not just blocks with metal."

Low-poly game-ready weapon prop. Clean geometry. No character attached — just the shield as a standalone item.

A medical syringe-gun weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A one-handed pistol-shaped medical tool approximately 35cm long. The overall silhouette is a hybrid between a chunky sci-fi pistol and a medical injector — a pistol grip at the back, a cylindrical body tapering to a wide emitter nozzle at the front.

The body is polished chrome with a clean, clinical finish — shinier and more refined than the other weapons in this universe. The chrome has subtle panel lines and medical cross markings etched into the side. Along the top of the barrel run two parallel transparent tubes filled with glowing golden-amber energy — these are the nanite reservoirs. The golden liquid energy is clearly visible through the tubes and emits a warm golden glow.

The emitter nozzle at the front is a wide, flared opening with a fine mesh grate, designed to spray nanite mist rather than fire projectiles. A small golden energy indicator light sits above the grip. The pistol grip is wrapped in dark rubber with ergonomic grooves for robotic fingers.

Color palette: polished chrome body, dark rubber grip, golden-amber energy tubes and indicator lights. The golden glow is warm and inviting — this is a healing tool, not a weapon of destruction.

## 3. Resonance Drill (Disrupt Orbital)

**Orbital:** Disrupt (Rebel archetype) -- Starting weapon
**Attachment:** `hand_R` (right hand grip)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/resonance-drill.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

A crystalline mining drill weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A one-handed mining drill approximately 50cm long. This is a repurposed industrial mining tool enhanced with mystical energy. The handle and motor housing at the back are made of dark steel with copper accent panels, riveted seams, and visible mechanical detail — pistons, vents, bolt heads. The grip is cylindrical with textured rubber and a trigger guard.

The drill bit itself is the focal point — a large conical drill bit approximately 25cm long, made of a dark metallic alloy. Running through the drill bit are prominent veins of teal-cyan crystalline energy, like glowing cracks or mineral veins embedded in the metal. The teal energy pulses through the spiraling grooves of the drill, creating a pattern where industrial steel and mystical resonance energy intertwine. The tip of the drill glows brightest with concentrated teal energy.

The transition zone between the motor housing and drill bit has a reinforced collar with small teal energy nodes — this is where the Orbital Resonance was channeled into the original mining tool.

Color palette: dark steel and copper housing, dark metallic drill bit with teal-cyan crystalline energy veins glowing throughout. The overall read is "industrial mining tool infused with forbidden energy."

## 4. Fabrication Gauntlet (Fabricate Orbital)

**Orbital:** Fabricate (Creator archetype)
**Attachment:** `forearm_L` (worn on left forearm, replaces hand)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/fabrication-gauntlet.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

```
A heavy mechanical gauntlet weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A bulky armored gauntlet that covers the entire forearm from elbow to fingertips, approximately 45cm long. This is a fabrication tool — a wearable 3D printer for a robot. The gauntlet is substantially larger than a normal arm, adding considerable bulk.

The forearm section is a heavy sleeve of dark steel plating with visible hydraulic lines running along the outside and articulated armor segments that allow elbow movement. Orange energy channels — glowing lines recessed into the armor — run along the forearm from elbow to wrist in parallel tracks, like circuitry traces.

The hand section has five articulated mechanical fingers, each with three visible joints and armored knuckle plates. The fingers are thicker than natural proportions — built for precision fabrication, not combat. In the center of the palm is a circular emitter nozzle — a recessed ring with a glowing orange energy core at the center. This is the 3D-printing output port. The orange glow from the palm nozzle is the brightest point on the entire gauntlet.

The wrist joint has a reinforced rotating collar with small orange indicator lights. The interior of the gauntlet (where the forearm inserts) is lined with dark rubber padding.

Color palette: dark steel armor plates, exposed hydraulic silver lines, orange energy channels and palm emitter glow, copper accents on joints. The gauntlet reads as "heavy industrial manufacturing tool worn as armor."

Low-poly game-ready weapon prop. Clean geometry. No character attached — just the gauntlet as a standalone item oriented as if worn on a left arm.

## 5. Gravity Boots (Pathfind Orbital)

**Orbital:** Pathfind (Explorer archetype)
**Attachment:** `foot_L` + `foot_R` (both feet, replacing default boots)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/gravity-boots.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

```
A pair of anti-gravity boots weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

Two sleek metallic boots designed for a humanoid robot, displayed side by side. Each boot extends from mid-calf to the sole, approximately 35cm tall. Unlike the bulky industrial aesthetic of other equipment in this universe, these boots are streamlined and aerodynamic — built for speed and agility.

The boot shell is brushed dark steel with a smooth, contoured surface following the shape of a robotic leg. Angular panel lines give each boot a slightly angular, aggressive silhouette. Along the ankle of each boot is a prominent energy ring — a glowing blue-cyan band that wraps fully around the ankle like a luminous bracelet. The rings emit a steady blue glow.

The soles of the boots are the key feature — instead of flat treaded soles, the underside of each boot has a recessed anti-gravity emitter. The emitter is a flat circular disc that glows bright blue, and beneath each boot a subtle visual distortion effect is suggested — a faint disc of warped blue energy hovering just below the sole, representing gravity displacement. Small blue energy vents on the heel and toe of each boot release faint energy wisps.

The calf section has a vertical stabilizer fin on the outer side of each boot — a small aerodynamic blade approximately 8cm tall, dark steel with a blue energy edge.

Color palette: brushed dark steel shell, blue-cyan ankle energy rings, bright blue sole emitters and gravity distortion, small blue accent vents. The boots read as "anti-gravity propulsion system disguised as footwear."

Low-poly game-ready weapon prop. Clean geometry. No character attached — both boots displayed as standalone items side by side.

## 6. Absorption Core (Transmute Orbital)

**Orbital:** Transmute (Magician archetype)
**Attachment:** Floating near `shoulder_R` (not held -- orbits near right shoulder)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/absorption-core.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

```
A floating energy orb weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A chrome sphere approximately 20cm in diameter that floats in the air — not held by any character. The sphere is the weapon itself: an Absorption Core that transmutes energy.

The outer shell is polished chrome with a mirror-like finish, but the shell is not complete — it has geometric cutaway sections, like triangular and hexagonal panels that have been removed or retracted, revealing the interior. Approximately 40 percent of the sphere surface is open, showing what is inside.

Through the cutaway openings, a swirling mass of purple-violet energy is visible inside the core. The purple energy is dense and plasma-like, with bright white-hot streaks spiraling within it. The energy casts purple light outward through every opening in the chrome shell, creating dramatic purple glow on the surrounding chrome panels.

The chrome panels that remain on the exterior have fine engraved circuit-like patterns etched into them — thin lines in geometric sacred geometry patterns (hexagons, triangles, interlocking circles). Three small chrome rings orbit the sphere at different angles — thin metallic bands approximately 5cm larger in diameter than the sphere, tilted at different axes, like an armillary sphere or gyroscope arrangement.

Color palette: mirror-chrome shell panels, deep purple-violet swirling energy inside, white-hot energy streaks, thin chrome orbital rings. The orb reads as "contained cosmic energy barely held in check by technology."

## 7. BattleNet Beacon (Command Orbital)

**Orbital:** Command (Ruler archetype)
**Attachment:** `hand_R` + `hand_L` (two-handed staff grip)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/battlenet-beacon.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

```
A tall tactical staff antenna weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A two-handed staff approximately 170cm tall — as tall as the wielder. This is a broadcast antenna that transmits tactical battlefield data. The design merges a traditional staff weapon with industrial communications technology.

The shaft is a straight, dark steel rod with an octagonal cross-section. The surface has a matte gunmetal finish with subtle vertical panel lines and small copper bolt accents at regular intervals. The lower third of the shaft has a textured grip wrap in dark rubber for two-handed wielding. The base (bottom tip) ends in a simple conical steel cap.

The top quarter of the staff is the beacon assembly. A golden energy dish sits at the very top — a concave parabolic disc approximately 25cm in diameter, angled slightly upward. The dish has a polished gold-bronze metallic finish and emits a warm golden glow from its concave surface. At the center of the dish, a small antenna spike protrudes upward approximately 10cm, tipped with a bright golden energy node.

Below the dish, the staff transitions through a technical section with exposed circuitry — small golden energy conduits, miniature antenna arrays branching outward like short horizontal prongs (3-4 of them, each about 8cm long), and indicator lights. This section is approximately 20cm long and is the most visually complex part of the staff.

Color palette: dark gunmetal steel shaft, copper bolt accents, golden-bronze dish and antenna elements, warm golden energy glow from the dish and conduits. The staff reads as "military command antenna built into a melee weapon."

Low-poly game-ready weapon prop. Clean geometry. No character attached — just the staff as a standalone item oriented vertically.

## 8. Archive Lens (Archive Orbital)

**Orbital:** Archive (Sage archetype)
**Attachment:** Floating near `head` (not held -- hovers near right eye)
**Save to:** `projects/iram/assets/models/weapons/archive-lens.glb`

### Meshy AI Prompt

```
A floating monocle lens weapon prop for a 3D action RPG. Industrial sci-fi design. Static model, no animation.

A hovering optical device approximately 12cm in diameter — a high-tech monocle that floats near the wielder's head without any physical attachment. This is a data lens that projects holographic information.

The main body is a circular lens frame made of polished gold-bronze metal with fine ornamental detailing — small engraved geometric patterns along the rim resembling circuit traces merged with Celtic knot motifs. The frame is approximately 2cm wide, forming a ring around the central lens.

The central lens is a disc of transparent teal-cyan energy — not glass, but a flat holographic projection surface. The teal lens has faint scrolling data patterns visible within it (like lines of code or ancient script flowing across the surface), giving it the appearance of an active display rather than passive optics.

From the edges of the lens frame, three small holographic projection fins extend outward — thin translucent teal blades approximately 5cm long, evenly spaced around the frame at the 2 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 10 o'clock positions. These fins emit the faintest teal glow and suggest that the lens is projecting data into the air around it.

A thin gold-bronze mechanical armature extends from the left side of the frame — a small articulated arm approximately 8cm long that curves backward, as if it would hook near the temple of the head. This armature does not touch anything — it floats along with the lens, hinting at how it might orient itself near the wearer's eye.

Color palette: polished gold-bronze frame, teal-cyan holographic lens and projection fins, faint teal glow. The lens reads as "floating AI-powered monocle projecting ancient data."

Low-poly game-ready weapon prop. Clean geometry. No character attached — just the floating lens as a standalone item.

## Attachment Reference

| # | Weapon | Orbital | Attachment Point | Notes |
|---|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Hard-Light Shield | Defend | `hand_L` | Gripped in left hand |
| 2 | Nano-Mist Emitter | Mend | `hand_R` | Held like a pistol in right hand |
| 3 | Resonance Drill | Disrupt | `hand_R` | Gripped in right hand (starting weapon) |
| 4 | Fabrication Gauntlet | Fabricate | `forearm_L` | Worn on entire left forearm |
| 5 | Gravity Boots | Pathfind | `foot_L` + `foot_R` | Both feet, replaces default foot mesh |
| 6 | Absorption Core | Transmute | Floating `shoulder_R` | Orbits near right shoulder, no contact |
| 7 | BattleNet Beacon | Command | `hand_R` + `hand_L` | Two-handed grip |
| 8 | Archive Lens | Archive | Floating `head` | Hovers near right eye, no contact |

## Generation Notes

- **Priority order:** Start with Resonance Drill (starting weapon) then Hard-Light Shield and Nano-Mist Emitter (common early unlocks).
- **Floating weapons** (Absorption Core, Archive Lens) will need runtime positioning via offset from the attachment bone rather than direct parenting. Use a small orbit/hover animation in the game engine, not baked into the GLB.
- **Gravity Boots** are exported as a single GLB containing both boots. They will be split or instanced at import time if the rig requires separate foot attachments.
- **Scale reference:** Unit 734 is approximately 170cm tall. Size all weapons relative to that proportion.
- **Emissive textures:** All weapons use emissive maps for their energy glow effects (teal, gold, orange, blue, purple). Set emissive intensity in the material so the glow is visible without post-processing bloom, but designed to look best with bloom enabled.
